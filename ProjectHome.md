SIGNlator is a system for Deaf and Mute Children where hearing parents and teachers can use it to make deaf children learn through stories. This will decrease the communication gap between normal people and deaf children.

This system allows the hearing person to tell a story in the form of Arabic speech, the speech will be recognized, and a 3D character will show the corresponding Arabic sign language in real time and a smooth way.

The system can be used to learn the Arabic sign language.
